mcJSON
======

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FSMaxB/mcJSON.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FSMaxB/mcJSON)

mcJSON is a Fork of [cJSON](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cjson/) with the goal of making it fit for creating JSON containing cryptographic keys and other confidential data without leaking this confidential data.

**THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, DON'T USE IT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING! If you're searching for a good JSON-Library, use cJSON, mcJSON doesn't do much more anyways at this point!**
